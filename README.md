This is actually two apps: the frontend and the server.

1. Create a Replit for the server. Copy in the server.js file and package.json and deploy. 
2. Grab the deployed Replit URL 
3. Create a Replit for the frontend and create a new Replit secret for REACT_APP_API_URL with the value of the deployed server URL
